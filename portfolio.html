            <h2>Face Generator</h2>
            <p>Objective: Build a simple generator that makes multiple variations of the same face.</p>
            <p>I wanted to constantly create faces, but still let the user freeze one whenever they want. To acchieve that I decided to 
                make a few of each facial feature and have a random function to go through all the opstions.</p>

            <p>Objective: Draw a place described to you in plain language through code.</p>
            <p>This is a p5 drawing I made using 2D primatives. The sketch was created upon a description of a memory.</p>

            <h2>Experimental Clock</h2>
            <p>Objective: Design and code an experimental clock that expresses a novel way of tracking time.</p>
            <p>Click on the black screen to begin! This is an experimental clock I did based on rythm. I wanted to represent how different 
                parts of a song give distinct time sensations.</p>

            <p>Objective: Design and code an animating optical illusion and consider its deployment.</p>
            <p>This is the optical ilusion I made. I used mouse position to make it interactive, movement to add dynamic, and played with blend modes.</p>

            <p>Objective: Create a data portrait out of a personal habit of yours.</p>
            <p>The data portrait reflects the probability of people in my contact list to answer my calls. I collected real data for a week and when you click on a letter (eg. C) it tries calling someone.</p>

        <p>Design and code a game that tells an aspect of your own story.</p>
        <p>It is a rhythm-based game, where both players need to hit keys according to the beats of a song. It represents the summer where me and my cousin would play games together.</p>
